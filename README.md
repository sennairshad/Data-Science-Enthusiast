This project is a Sales Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into the key performance indicators (KPIs) of sales, profits, cost of goods sold (COGS), and quantity sold. Additionally, it breaks down sales by segments, products, and countries, giving a comprehensive view of business performance.
